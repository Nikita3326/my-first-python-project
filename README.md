**📁 Project Descriptions:** *📝 Project based on an exercise from Class 11 Computer Science Book by Sumita Arora. 👨‍🎓 Implemented as part of my learning journey. 📘 This is for educational and portfolio purposes only.*

**"These are my very first Python programs as I start learning. Each one helps me understand the basics like variables, user input, conditionals, and arithmetic operations. More to come!"**

Here are the small beginner-level Python projects included in this repository:

BMI_calculator.py What it does: Calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your height and weight. How it works: You input your height and weight, and it uses the BMI formula: BMI = weight / (height * height) (typically in meters and kilograms) Then it tells you whether you're underweight, normal, overweight, etc.

area&primeter_paralelogram.py What it does: Finds the area and perimeter of a parallelogram. How it works: It asks for the base, height, and side length, then uses formulas: Area = base × height Perimeter = 2 × (base + side)

area_of_circle.py What it does: Calculates the area of a circle. How it works: You give the radius, and it uses the formula: Area = π × radius² (π is usually approximated as 3.14 or from the math module)

area_rectange.py What it does: Computes the area of a rectangle. How it works: You input the length and width, and it uses: Area = length × width

arithmetic_operations.py What it does: Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.). How it works: Takes two numbers and performs operations like +, -, *, /, possibly showing a menu or letting the user choose the operation.

cube.py What it does: Calculates the cube of a number. How it works: You enter a number, and it simply returns number³.

hypotenuse.py What it does: Calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. How it works: You input the lengths of the two shorter sides, and it uses the Pythagorean theorem: hypotenuse = √(a² + b²)

km_to_miles_convertor.py What it does: Converts distance from kilometers to miles. How it works: You enter kilometers, and it multiplies by 0.621371 to get miles.

reversing.py What it does: Reverses a given number or string. How it works: Takes input, uses slicing or loops to reverse and print the result.

simple_intrest_calc.py What it does: Calculates simple interest based on principal, rate, and time. How it works: Uses the formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100

tonnes_to_quintals_and_kilograms.py What it does: Converts weight from tonnes to quintals and kilograms. How it works: 1 tonne = 10 quintals 1 tonne = 1000 kilograms It takes the input in tonnes and converts it into both units.
