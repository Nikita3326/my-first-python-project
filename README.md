**üìÅ Project Descriptions**

**"These are my very first Python programs as I start learning. Each one helps me understand the basics like variables, user input, conditionals, and arithmetic operations. More to come!"**

Here are the small beginner-level Python projects included in this repository:

**BMI_calculator.py**
A simple Body Mass Index calculator that takes the user's weight and height, calculates the BMI, and tells whether the person is underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

**area_of_circle.py**
This program calculates the area of a circle using the radius provided by the user. It uses the formula œÄ √ó r¬≤ and helps understand basic math operations in Python.

**area_rectangle.py**
A basic Python script to compute the area of a rectangle. It asks for the length and width as input and returns the area.

**arithmetic_operations.py**
A mini calculator that performs all basic arithmetic operations ‚Äî addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division ‚Äî based on user input.

**cube.py**
A small program that calculates the cube of a given number. This was mainly created to understand exponentiation in Python.

**km_to_miles_convertor.py**
Converts kilometers into miles using a standard conversion formula. Good practice for handling user input and basic math.

**tonnes_to_quintals_and_kilograms.py**
A converter that takes weight in tonnes and converts it into both quintals and kilograms. Great for learning multiple outputs from a single input.
